Daemonization
-------------

There's a helper api lws_daemonize built by default that does everything you
need to daemonize well, including creating a lock file.  If you're making
what's basically a daemon, just call this early in your init to fork to a
headless background process and exit the starting process.

Notice stdout, stderr, stdin are all redirected to /dev/null to enforce your
daemon is headless, so you'll need to sort out alternative logging, by, eg,
syslog.


Maximum number of connections
-----------------------------

The maximum number of connections the library can deal with is decided when
it starts by querying the OS to find out how many file descriptors it is
allowed to open (1024 on Fedora for example).  It then allocates arrays that
allow up to that many connections, minus whatever other file descriptors are
in use by the user code.

If you want to restrict that allocation, or increase it, you can use ulimit or
similar to change the avaiable number of file descriptors, and when restarted
libwebsockets will adapt accordingly.


Fragmented messages
-------------------

To support fragmented messages you need to check for the final
frame of a message with libwebsocket_is_final_fragment. This
check can be combined with libwebsockets_remaining_packet_payload
to gather the whole contents of a message, eg:

    case LWS_CALLBACK_RECEIVE:
    {
        Client * const client = (Client *)user;
        const size_t remaining = libwebsockets_remaining_packet_payload(wsi);

        if (!remaining && libwebsocket_is_final_fragment(wsi)) {
            if (client->HasFragments()) {
                client->AppendMessageFragment(in, len, 0);
                in = (void *)client->GetMessage();
                len = client->GetMessageLength();
            }

            client->ProcessMessage((char *)in, len, wsi);
            client->ResetMessage();
        } else
            client->AppendMessageFragment(in, len, remaining);
    }
    break;

The test app llibwebsockets-test-fraggle sources also show how to
deal with fragmented messages.

Debug Logging
-------------

Also using lws_set_log_level api you may provide a custom callback to actually
emit the log string.  By default, this points to an internal emit function
that sends to stderr.  Setting it to NULL leaves it as it is instead.

A helper function lwsl_emit_syslog() is exported from the library to simplify
logging to syslog.  You still need to use setlogmask, openlog and closelog
in your user code.

The logging apis are made available for user code.

lwsl_err(...)
lwsl_warn(...)
lwsl_notice(...)
lwsl_info(...)
lwsl_debug(...)

The difference between notice and info is that notice will be logged by default
whereas info is ignored by default.


External Polling Loop support
-----------------------------

libwebsockets maintains an internal poll() array for all of its
sockets, but you can instead integrate the sockets into an
external polling array.  That's needed if libwebsockets will
cooperate with an existing poll array maintained by another
server.

Four callbacks LWS_CALLBACK_ADD_POLL_FD, LWS_CALLBACK_DEL_POLL_FD,
LWS_CALLBACK_SET_MODE_POLL_FD and LWS_CALLBACK_CLEAR_MODE_POLL_FD
appear in the callback for protocol 0 and allow interface code to
manage socket descriptors in other poll loops.
